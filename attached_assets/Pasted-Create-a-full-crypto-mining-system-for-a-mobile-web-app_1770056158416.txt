Create a full crypto mining system for a mobile/web application with modular architecture and unlimited growth.

Mining System:

Mining starts only when the user presses a “Start Mining” button.

Each mining session lasts exactly 4 hours.

Normal base mining produces 120 coins per day, divided into 6 sessions.

Each session generates exactly 20 coins, distributed continuously per second during the 4-hour session.

Users must manually start each new session after the previous one ends.

There is no hard daily cap on total coins earned.

Base mining values represent normal mining only, without boosts, tasks, or referrals.

Tasks System:

Provide a Tasks page with multiple tasks.

Each task rewards exactly 10 coins.

Tasks must be verified as completed before rewarding.

Once verified, rewards are added immediately to the user’s total balance.

Task rewards are not limited by mining values.

Boost (Ads) System:

Include a Boost Mining page with optional video ads.

Each watched ad grants a +10% mining boost for the current mining session only.

Maximum boost per session is 100%.

Boost is applied progressively (10% per ad).

Boost resets at the start of every new 4-hour session.

Boost affects only mining output and does not affect tasks or referral rewards.

Referral System:

Users can invite others using a referral code or link.

Each confirmed and active referral grants 50 coins (rewarded once per referral).

Referral rewards are added directly to the total balance.

Referral rewards are independent from mining sessions and boosts.

General Rules:

All rewards (mining, tasks, boosts, referrals) are cumulative.

No reward type limits or blocks another.

The system must allow unlimited total balance growth.

All modules must be manageable via an admin dashboard.

Referral Leaderboard System:

Create a leaderboard page split into two top sections:

Miner Referrals (user referral code + total referrals),

Leaderboard (miners ranked by referral count).

Display the top 3 miners in a podium style (gold, silver, bronze) with username/ID.

Below the podium, list ranks 4–100 with username/ID and referral count.

Rankings update daily based on referral activity.

Handle ties by ranking users with earlier referrals higher.

Automatically reward the top 3 miners daily, adding rewards cumulatively to their balance.

Provide placeholders for avatars and allow leaderboard data export.

Use a clean, modern crypto/gaming UI suitable for mobile and web.
